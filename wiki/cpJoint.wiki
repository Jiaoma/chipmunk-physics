=Chipmunk joints: `cpJoint`=

==Joint Types:==

There are currently 4 kinds of joints:

 * *Pin Joints* connect two rigid bodies with a solid pin or rod. It keeps the anchor points at a set distance from one another.
 * *Slide Joints* are like pin joints, but have a minimum and maximum distance. A chain could be modeled using this joint. It keeps the anchor points from getting to far apart, but will allow them to get closer together.
 * *Pivot Joints* simply allow two objects to pivot about a single point.
 * *Groove Joints* attach a point on one body to a groove on the other. Think of it as a sliding pivot joint.

==Shared Memory ManagementFunctions:==

{{{
void cpJointDestroy(cpJoint *joint)
void cpJointFree(cpJoint *joint)
}}}

 `Destroy` and `Free` functions are shared by all joint types. Allocation and initialization functions are specific to each joint type.
 
=Joint Constructors:=

==Pin Joints:==

{{{
cpPinJoint *cpPinJointAlloc(void)
cpPinJoint *cpPinJointInit(cpPinJoint *joint, cpBody *a, cpBody *b, cpVect anchr1, cpVect anchr2)
cpJoint *cpPinJointNew(cpBody *a, cpBody *b, cpVect anchr1, cpVect anchr2)
}}}

 `a` and `b` are the two bodies to connect, and `anchr1` and `anchr2` are the anchor points on those bodies.

==Slide Joints:==

{{{
cpSlideJoint *cpSlideJointAlloc(void)
cpSlideJoint *cpSlideJointInit(cpSlideJoint *joint, cpBody *a, cpBody *b, cpVect anchr1, cpVect anchr2, cpFloat min, cpFloat max)
cpJoint *cpSlideJointNew(cpBody *a, cpBody *b, cpVect anchr1, cpVect anchr2, cpFloat min, cpFloat max)
}}}

 `a` and `b` are the two bodies to connect, `anchr1` and `anchr2` are the anchor points on those bodies, and `min` and `max` define the allowed distances of the anchor points.

==Pivot Joints:==

{{{
cpPivotJoint *cpPivotJointAlloc(void)
cpPivotJoint *cpPivotJointInit(cpPivotJoint *joint, cpBody *a, cpBody *b, cpVect pivot)
cpJoint *cpPivotJointNew(cpBody *a, cpBody *b, cpVect pivot)
}}}

 `a` and `b` are the two bodies to connect, and `pivot` is the point in world coordinates of the pivot. Because the pivot location is given in world coordinates, you must have the bodies moved into the correct positions already.

==Groove Joint:==

{{{
cpGrooveJoint *cpGrooveJointAlloc(void)
cpGrooveJoint *cpGrooveJointInit(cpGrooveJoint *joint, cpBody *a, cpBody *b, cpVect groove_a, cpVect groove_b, cpVect anchr2)
cpJoint *cpGrooveJointNew(cpBody *a, cpBody *b, cpVect groove_a, cpVect groove_b, cpVect anchr2)
}}}

 The groove goes from _groov_a_ to _groove_b_ on body _a_, and the pivot is attached to _anchr2_ on body _b_. All coordinates are body local.

=Notes:=

 * You can add multiple joints between two bodies, but make sure that they don't fight. It can cause the bodies to explode.
 * Make sure you add both of the connected bodies and the joint to a space.
