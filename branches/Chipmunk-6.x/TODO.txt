Fix units for damped springs
Breakable joints?
Separate impulse application for joints
breakable object support functions
constraint callbacks
touch joint (Objective-Chipmunk)
per body damping and gravity coefs?
Better accuracy for variable timestepping?

Notes:
* don't push arbiters to rogue bodies, and don't push constraints or arbiters to static ones
* Need to copy the arbiter contact list instead of re-calling collision
