Fix units for damped springs
Breakable joints?
Separate impulse application for joints
breakable object support functions
constraint callbacks
touch joint (Objective-Chipmunk)
Per body damping and gravity coefs?
Per body iterations and timestep?
Better accuracy for variable timestepping?
Functions to check if space contains shapes, bodies, constraints?
Building bodies from shape collections.

Notes:
* don't push arbiters to rogue bodies, and don't push constraints or arbiters to static ones
* Need to copy the arbiter contact list instead of re-calling collision
