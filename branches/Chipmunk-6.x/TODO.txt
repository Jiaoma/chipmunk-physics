constraint callbacks
touch joint (Objective-Chipmunk)
Building bodies from shape collections.

Better accuracy for variable timestepping?
  - dt independent collision bias?
  - dt independent joint biasing?

Quickhull?
Concave decomposition?


Future features to think about:
Per body iterations and timestep?
Per body damping and gravity coefs?
breakable object support functions?
Breakable joints?
Easy callback programable joint?
