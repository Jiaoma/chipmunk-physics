Fix units for damped springs
Separate impulse application for joints
constraint callbacks
touch joint (Objective-Chipmunk)
Building bodies from shape collections.

Better accuracy for variable timestepping?
  - dt independent collision bias?
  - dt independent joint biasing? (ugh)
  - apply fixed impulse for joints (ugh)


Per body iterations and timestep?
Per body damping and gravity coefs?
breakable object support functions?
Breakable joints?
Easy callback programable joint?
