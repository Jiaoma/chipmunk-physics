touch joint (Objective-Chipmunk)

Better accuracy for variable timestepping?
  - dt independent joint biasing?

Future features to think about:
constraint callbacks?
Building bodies from shape collections.
Quickhull?
Concave decomposition?
Per body iterations and timestep?
Per body damping and gravity coefs?
breakable object support functions?
Breakable joints?
Easy callback programable joint?
